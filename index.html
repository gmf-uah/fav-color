<!--
Goals of this webpage:
1. Prompt the user for their favorite color
2a. When the user begins typing, suggest the closest <=5 results from CSS's list of 140 named colors
2b. Use fuse.js to implement the fuzzy search
3. When the user selects a color, change the background color of the page to that color
4. Revisiting the webpage should remember the user's color choice and set the background accordingly

Secondary but important goals:
1a. Make the input text box transparent, but the placeholder and input text readable
1b. Make the input text box have a nice rounded border and a circular enter button on the right side
2a. When the user enters a valid color, the page should gradually transition to that color
2b. Page color should have an attractive gradient
3. Prompt text, input text, and input border should have color contrast with the background 
4. Placeholder text should have a random color from the list of CSS colors
